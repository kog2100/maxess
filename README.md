ETH MAXess
==========

This repository contains ETH's code for the MAXess project, and its extensions after the end of said project.
The code is related to estimating joint destination-mode choice models from data
in the form of a MATSim population, and computing the expected maximum utility
from said model on each MATSim agent.
